Week 8 Submission

**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating 'user stories' help with this?**

Interpreting user needs involves gathering requirements through direct communication, surveys, or feedback. This information is then translated into specific features or functionalities. Creating user stories helps by breaking down these needs into clear, actionable tasks. Each user story describes what the user wants, why it matters, and what the expected outcome should be, guiding the development process with a user-focused perspective.

**How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**

I approach program development by starting with clear goals, planning features in manageable increments, and continuously testing and refining the code. I hope to incorporate Agile processes such as iterative development, sprint planning, and regular team reviews. These practices promote adaptability, transparency, and continuous improvement throughout the development lifecycle.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**

Being a good team member in software development means collaborating effectively, communicating clearly, and being open to feedback. It involves sharing knowledge, supporting teammates, and contributing to a positive work environment. A good team member is also accountable, meets deadlines, and actively participates in team discussions and problem-solving efforts.
